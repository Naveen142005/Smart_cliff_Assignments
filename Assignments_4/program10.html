      10) Bank ATM Simulation (While + Break/Continue) 
    Problem:  
    ATM operations: 
    User starts with ₹10,000. 
    Allowed operations: Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance. 
    Withdraw must fail if balance < amount. 
    The loop continues until the user selects "Exit". 
    Use while(true) + break and continue for invalid input. 
    Sample Test Cases (scripted ops):  
    Deposit 1000 → Withdraw 300 → Balance → Exit
    </pre>
    <script>
      const Bank_ATM_Simulation = () => {
        let balance = 10000;

        while (true) {
          let operation = prompt(
            "Enter operation (Deposit, Withdraw, Balance, Exit):"
          );

          if (operation === "Exit")
             break;

          if (!["Deposit", "Withdraw", "Balance"].includes(operation)) {
            alert("Invalid operation");
            continue;
          }

          if (operation === "Deposit") {
            let amount = parseInt(prompt("Enter amount to deposit:"));
  
            balance += amount;
            alert(`Deposited ₹${amount}. New balance: ₹${balance}`);

          }

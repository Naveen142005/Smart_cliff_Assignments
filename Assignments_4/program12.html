  <pre>12) Traffic Light Controller 
Problem:  
Simulate traffic lights with states: 
"Green" → cars move 
"Yellow" → prepare to stop 
"Red" → stop 
Cycle through these 3 states infinitely. After 5 cycles, stop the loop using switch + 
cnt + break. 
Sample Test Cases:  
Output: sequence of states; ends with “Stopped after 5 cycles” </pre>

      const Traffic_light_controller = () => {
        let states = [];
        let cnt = 0;

        while (cnt < 5) {
          switch (cnt % 3) {
            case 0:
              states.push("Green");
              break;
            case 1:
              states.push("Yellow");
              break;
            case 2:
              states.push("Red");
              break;
          }
          cnt++;
        }
        states.push("Stopped after 5 cycles");
        return states;
      };
      console.log(Traffic_light_controller());

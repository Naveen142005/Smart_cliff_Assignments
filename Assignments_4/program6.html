      6) Number Guessing  
Problem:  
Simulate a guessing game where a user must guess a number between 1–10. Use a do...while 
loop to ensure the user is prompted at least once, and stop only when the guess matches the 
secret number. 
Sample Test Cases:  
Simulated guesses: [3,7,5] with secret 5 → stops at 5 
    </pre>
    
    <script>
      // secret number
      let secret_code = 5;
      let guessed = -1;

      // keep asking until correct
      do {
        guessed = Number(prompt("Enter number between 1 to 10"));

        // check guess
        if (guessed === secret_code) {
          console.log("You guessed it right");
          break;
        } else {
          console.log("Try again");
        }

      } while (secret_code !== guessed);

9) Online Exam Rules  
Problem:  
A student can submit the exam only if: 
Time left > 0, AND 
Student has answered at least 1 question, AND 
Has not already submitted. 
If any condition fails, output "Submission Failed" with the reason. Implement using if-else 
with compound conditions. 
Sample Test Cases:  
time=10, answered=5, submitted=false → “Submission Accepted”  
time=0, answered=5, submitted=false → “Submission Failed: No time left”  
time=10, answered=0, submitted=false → “Submission Failed: No answers”  
time=10, answered=2, submitted=true → “Submission Failed: Already submitted”</pre

    <script>
      const online_exam = (time, answered, submitted) => {
        if (time <= 0) return "Submission Failed: No time left";
        if (answered < 1) return "Submission Failed: No answers";
        if (submitted) return "Submission Failed: Already submitted";
        return "Submission Accepted";
      };

      //Sample test cases
      console.log(online_exam(10, 5, false)); // "Submission Accepted"
      console.log(online_exam(0, 5, false)); // "Submission Failed: No time left"
      console.log(online_exam(10, 0, false)); // "Submission Failed: No answers"
      console.log(online_exam(10, 2, true)); // "Submission Failed: Already submitted"
